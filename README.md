Cirno, the ⑨-generation programming language
===================

Cirno is an extension of the programming language Brainfuck. However, Unlike Brainfuck, Cirno is designed to be a general purpose language with practical use. 

The ⑨ design rule of Cirno
----------
 1. When there are two ways to do one thing, seek for three!
 2. The language that can not be completely understand by baka is not the good language!
 3. Cirno is too baka to prevent any kind of misuse!
 4. 1 + 1 = 9, thus the more the better!
 5. Cirno loves ice lollies so every feature should help her get ice lollies!
 6. Cirno has a short term memory and cannot remember the past! So she would often break backward compatibility!
 7. Extensibility! Cirno has six pluggable wings!
 8. Cirno is the strongest and can conqueror anything!
 9. Anyone reading up to this line is a big baka!
